PyMathProg examples (using excellent Python library from http://pymprog.sourceforge.net/)

An excellent modeling library already exists in Python for glpk.
Python (thank you generator expressions) is a natural for this.
Trying to get a feel for the library by doing the same examples in the AMPL book.

Not using the parameters feature because expressions like 1/rate[i] or being used as constraint bounds would not work. Also AMPL does not have an equivalent facility: http://ampl.com/faqs/how-do-i-get-ranges-and-other-sensitivity-analyses/
