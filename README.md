PyMathProg examples (using excellent Python library from http://pymprog.sourceforge.net/)

An excellent modeling library already exists in Python for glpk.
Python (thank you generator expressions) is a natural for this.
Trying to get a feel for the library by doing the same examples in the AMPL book.
